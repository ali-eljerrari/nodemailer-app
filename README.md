# Nodemailer Express.js App

This is a simple Express.js application that demonstrates how to use Nodemailer for sending emails.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodemailer-express-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nodemailer-express-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Open the `config.js` file and update the `mailOptions` object with your email configuration details such as `service`, `auth.user`, `auth.pass`, `from`, etc.

2. If you are using a service like Gmail, you may need to allow less secure apps to access your account. Alternatively, you can set up an app-specific password.

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Fill out the form and click "Send Email" to send a test email.
